# COVID-19
Downloaded the Covid-19 case and death data from data.european.eu and created a code to automate charts on Python using Pandas and Plotly. To run the program you will need to install pandas and plotly onto your notebook using the terminal. Download and Save the Python file and Excel file at the same location. The charts are set to show Covid Cases by Country. To make the graph interactive go to line 9 in the excel file "data = [go.Scatter( x=df['COUNTRY AND TERRITORY'], y=df['CASES'])]" and change the x and y axis with the coloumn heading: DATE, DAY,	MONTH, YEAR, CASES, DEATHS, COUNTRY AND TERRITORY, geoId, COUNTRY AND TERRITORY CODE, POPULATION and CONTINENT.

Need to use .csv files instead of .xlsx files.
Provide Python  code execution steps.
